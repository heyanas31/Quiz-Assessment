# "Quiz-Assessment"
# Overview:
The Quiz Assessment System using a Client-Server Model with TCP Concurrent Connections is designed to efficiently handle multiple student assessments simultaneously in a networked environment. In this system, the server acts as a central controller, hosting quizzes and managing communication with multiple clients (students) over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to ensure reliable data transmission. Server can handle multiple client connections at the same time without interference, enabling each student to participate in the quiz independently and securely. This architecture ensures low latency, data integrity, and a scalable structure suitable for educational institutions conducting real-time online assessments.

# Working:
The working of the Quiz Assessment System begins with the client logging into the system using a valid ID and password, which are verified by the server to ensure secure access. Once authenticated, the client is presented with a list of available courses, from which they can select the desired course to attempt the quiz. After the course selection, the server sends the corresponding quiz to the client, and the client proceeds to answer the questions. Upon completion, the client submits the answers, which are sent to the server via the TCP connection. The server then evaluates the responses in real-time and sends the quiz result back to the client. Throughout the process, concurrent handling allows multiple clients to perform these operations simultaneously without delay or conflict.

# Login System:
The client enter their ID and password, which are then sent to the server over a TCP connection. The server receives these credentials and verifies them against a stored database or record. If the ID and password are correct, the server responds with a "Login Successful" message, allowing the client to proceed further. If the credentials are incorrect, the server sends back a "Login Error" message, prompting the client to try again. This process ensures secure and controlled access to the quiz system. 

# Courses Selection:
The course selection system allows the client to choose from a list of three available courses: Computer Communication, Data Structures, and Object Oriented Programming. After a successful login, the client is presented with this course list and selects the desired course for the quiz. This selected course information is then sent to the server over the TCP connection, which identifies the corresponding quiz based on the chosen course. The server then prepares and sends the quiz questions related to that course back to the client. This system ensures that each client receives the appropriate quiz content based on their selection.

# Quiz System:
In the quiz system , the server will do text file handling to get questions stored in file and then send to the client. Once the client receives the quiz questions from the server based on the selected course, they proceed to answer each question, typically in the form of multiple-choice options. The client’s answers are stored in a character array, with each character representing the selected option for a question (e.g., 'A', 'B', or 'C'). After completing the quiz, this character array sent back to the server via the TCP connection. The server then compares the received answers with the correct answer key for that quiz and calculates the total score.

# Result Storage System:
In the result system, after evaluating the client’s answers, the server calculates the final score based on the number of correct responses. Once the score is computed, the server sends the result back to the client over the TCP connection, allowing the client to view their performance instantly. Simultaneously, the server also stores the result in a CSV file, recording important details such as the client ID, selected course, and obtained score. This ensures that all quiz attempts are securely logged and can be referenced later for record-keeping or analysis purposes. 

# Error Handling:
The system includes error handling at each input stage to ensure data validity and smooth operation. For example, the client cannot proceed to course selection without successful login, and if invalid credentials are entered, an error message prompts for re-entry. Similarly, during course selection or quiz submission, the system checks for valid inputs only, and prevents the client from moving to the next step until the current input is correctly provided. This ensures a controlled and error-free flow throughout the quiz process.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Quiz Assessment System using the Client-Server Model with TCP Concurrent Connections provides a secure, efficient, and interactive platform for conducting online assessments. From user authentication and course selection to answer submission and result evaluation, each step is designed with clear communication and robust error handling to ensure reliability. The system allows multiple clients to participate simultaneously without interruption, thanks to concurrent connection handling. By also logging results in a CSV file, it supports easy record-keeping and analysis. Overall, this system offers a practical and scalable solution for educational institutions to manage quizzes in a structured and automated manner.
